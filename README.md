## FlightAware-like System

A mini Flight Tracking System built using FastAPI and MongoDB.
It simulates a real-time radar that receives flight updates, stores them in a database, and visualizes flight paths on an interactive Folium map.

## Overview

This system tracks flights in real-time by:

-Receiving live position updates (latitude, longitude, altitude, speed)

-Storing them in MongoDB

-Displaying active flights and their routes on a dynamic map (/map)

##  API Endpoints

- **GET /**  
  → Returns a welcome message (verifies API is running)

- **POST /update**  
  → Adds or updates a flight’s location and details  
  → Creates a new record if the flight doesn’t exist

- **GET /flights**  
  → Fetches all active flights with their tracking data

- **GET /{flight_id}**  
  → Retrieves a specific flight’s latest or timestamp-based location

- **PUT /complete/{flight_id}**  
  → Marks a flight as completed (landed) and moves it to logs

- **GET /logs/{flight_id}**  
  → Fetches data for a completed (landed) flight

- **DELETE /flights/{flight_id}**  
  → Deletes a flight and refreshes the map

- **GET /map**  
  → Displays the live map with all active flight routes
